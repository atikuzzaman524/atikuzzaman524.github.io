Its main weakness is the **candidate generation step**. To find frequent itemsets of size `k`, it must first generate all possible candidate itemsets of size `k` and then scan the entire dataset to count their support. For large datasets with many unique items, this process can be incredibly slow and memory-intensive.\n","\n","**The FP-Growth Solution**\n","The FP-Growth algorithm was designed to overcome this bottleneck. It's a \"divide and conquer\" algorithm that is often significantly faster than Apriori. It works in two main steps and avoids explicit candidate generation entirely:\n","\n","1.  **Build the FP-Tree**: FP-Growth scans the dataset once to find all frequent 1-itemsets. It then scans the data a second time to build a highly compact tree structure called the **FP-Tree**. This tree stores the entire transactional database in a compressed form, with more frequent items closer to the root.\n","\n","2.  **Mine the FP-Tree**: The algorithm then recursively mines this tree to find frequent itemsets. It starts with the least frequent items and explores their \"conditional pattern bases\" (the paths they appear in) to build small, conditional FP-Trees, from which it extracts frequent itemsets. This recursive process is much more efficient than generating and testing trillions of candidates."],"metadata":{"id":"1Yu6p6D_IzMR"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### **Part 2: Dataset & Preprocessing**\n","\n","To directly compare FP-Growth with Apriori, we will use the exact same real-world **Online Retail dataset** and apply the identical preprocessing steps from the previous lab.

Imagine a tree where each node is an item, and the path from the root to a node represents a transaction. More frequent items are placed closer to the root. Each node also contains a counter for how many transactions share that path. Crucially, a \"header table\" stores pointers to all nodes of a particular item, allowing the algorithm to quickly traverse all transactions containing that item without rescanning the database.\n","\n","* **FP-Growth vs. Apriori - When to Choose Which?**\n","    * **FP-Growth**: This should be your default choice. It is generally much faster, especially on large datasets or when using low support thresholds. Its main potential drawback is memory usage, as the FP-Tree must be held in memory.\n","    * **Apriori**: While slower, its implementation can be more straightforward if building from scratch, and it may be memory-efficient for certain sparse datasets where the number of candidates generated at each step is not overwhelming. For most practical applications using libraries like `mlxtend`, FP-Growth is superior.\n","\n","* **Modern Frequent Pattern Mining:**\n","    For truly massive datasets (\"Big Data\") that do not fit into the memory of a single machine, frequent pattern mining is performed on distributed computing platforms. **Apache Spark** has a popular, built-in parallelized implementation of FP-Growth that can scale to terabytes of data by distributing the construction and mining of the FP-Tree across a cluster of computers."],"metadata":{"id":"3UmwEbi_Kehl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["---\n","  \n","<center>\n","\n","<span style=\"color:#1f4e79\">\n","\n","Prepared By\n","\n","**<span style=\"font-size:1.5em\">Md.
