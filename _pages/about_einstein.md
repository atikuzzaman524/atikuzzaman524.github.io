I am Md. Atikuzzaman, a passionate researcher and educator specializing in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Medical Imaging. Currently, I serve as a Lecturer in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Green University of Bangladesh. I hold a Master of Artificial Intelligence from Kyung Hee University, Republic of Korea, where I conducted research on urban cellular traffic prediction using feature modulation in densely connected convolutional networks.

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have been actively involved in research, publishing in peer-reviewed journals and conferences. My work spans areas such as trash classification, vehicle license plate recognition, and deep learning-based anomaly detection.

Beyond research, I have a strong teaching background, with experience mentoring students in machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence. I also actively contribute to open-source projects, academic conferences, and technical workshops.

I am always eager to explore cutting-edge AI technologies, collaborate on innovative research, and contribute to the advancement of intelligent systems that solve real-world challenges.
